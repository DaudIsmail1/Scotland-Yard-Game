## Features
- **Dynamic Game Management:** Tracks all players, their locations, tickets, and turns throughout the game.  
- **Flexible Move Handling:** Supports different types of moves for detectives and Mr. X, including hidden moves.  
- **Real-Time Win Detection:** Automatically identifies when a player or team wins the game.
- **Immutable and Extensible Architecture:** Updates game state safely without side effects, and is designed so new rules or player types can be added easily.  
- **Robust and Testable:** Game logic is thoroughly tested to ensure correctness and reliability.

## Technical Highlights 
- **Java OOP:** Classes, interfaces, and inheritance for modular and reusable code.
- **Game logic implementation:** Encodes Scotland Yard rules including movement, ticket usage, and turn order.
- **Immutable state updates:** Ensures game states are correctly updated without side effects.
- **Design Patterns:** Utilizes the Visitor pattern to process different move types cleanly and efficiently.
